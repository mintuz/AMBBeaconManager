#AMBBeaconManager
================

Just playing around with iOS7's iBeacons. 

AMBBeaconManager is a very simple class, it hasn't even been tested. 
I Will use this as a basis for a future project I want to work on but thought it might be useful for someone else.

Just include AMBBeaconManager at the top of your class and run the various methods.
